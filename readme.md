# sml-libs

Signatures for various SML libraries.

Originally a part of [Millet](https://github.com/azdavis/millet) that I pulled out into its own repo.

Mostly scraped from public documentation websites using [sml-basis](https://github.com/azdavis/sml-basis). (I know, the naming doesn't really make sense. Oops.)
