# sml-libs

Signatures for various SML libraries.

Originally a part of [Millet][] that I pulled out into its own repo.

Mostly scraped from public documentation websites using [sml-libs-scraper][], with some manual formatting tweaks.

## Licenses

Most of the the SML files within are basically just remixes/alternative presentations of content from various public websites.

Each directory in `src` came from different sources, and are covered by different licenses.

| [`smlnj_lib`][]       | `LICENSE-SMLNJ.txt`     |
| [`std_basis`][]       | `LICENSE-STD-BASIS.txt` |
